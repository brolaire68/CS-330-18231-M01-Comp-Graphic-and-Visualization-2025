CS 330 Final Project Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by identifying the project’s core requirements and mapping out a structure that is easy to expand and maintain. I focus on breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable components. For this project, I designed the 3D scene layout first and then planned how the textures, lighting, and camera would interact.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me strengthen my skills in spatial design, especially positioning objects in 3D space relative to lighting and perspective. I also developed a stronger understanding of how textures and color choices impact the visual clarity and engagement of a scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process. First, I sketched a basic idea of my 3D scene, then built a simple version in OpenGL. I added complexity through layers: first objects, then textures, then lighting, and finally fine-tuning the camera and user interaction.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking a large project into smaller steps, building incrementally, and testing as I go is a tactic that can apply to any future software project. It helps catch problems early and makes the project less overwhelming.

How do I approach developing programs?
I start by setting up a basic working version first, even if it’s very simple. Once the program runs without errors, I gradually add features while constantly testing. I prioritize clean, modular code and add comments to keep the project maintainable.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used version control habits (like backing up working versions) and learned to modularize my code better by separating object creation, movement, and collision logic. I also used more real-time debugging techniques, testing small changes before making big ones.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential. I frequently built a small piece (like loading a texture), tested it, then moved onto the next piece. When something didn’t look right, I adjusted lighting, positioning, or angles in small increments until I achieved the look I wanted.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Earlier milestones taught me to be more cautious about how small errors (like loading a bad texture or incorrect light positioning) can impact an entire project. By the final project, I built better habits like modular coding, commenting thoroughly, and testing each element separately before integration.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the ability to solve problems logically, build interactive systems, and create visualizations that can be used for education, simulation, entertainment, or training. These skills are valuable for many career fields I am interested in.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with computational graphics improved my understanding of how computers represent space, texture, and light. This helps me in future computer science courses, especially if I work in fields like simulations, game development, or data visualization.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics help me bring ideas to life visually, which is an important skill in industries like software development, simulation training, UI/UX design, and even cybersecurity. Being able to create and manage 3D environments is a highly marketable technical skill.
